<h1> About Me: </h1>
<p> I am a double major in CS and English, and everytime I tell someone that, I always get a response similar to "That's an interesting combination." Many people like to look at the field of computer science as indistinguishable from tech culture, and perhaps, on some points, they are inseparable. However, I've always firmly felt that computer science, particularly if you delve into the theory side, can be more than hackathons and constantly pounding out lines of code. From my perspective, English and CS fit together perfectly; both languages require deep readings of syntax and expressions along with the ability to see the big picture: what does this piece of work do and why do we need it or want it? </p>
<p> My point is that sometimes, determining whether a program is even needed is far more helpful than spending hours writing something that will never be used. Serious, intellectual thought on design can streamline most projects, and
innovative thinking can accelerate the rest </p>
<p> Beyond the world of coding, I'm working on a novel (very, very slowly). I am a Jane Austen fanatic. I play the ukulele, hold CS office hours for my sorority sisters, and knit. </p>
